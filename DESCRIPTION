Description: Dynamic factor models constitute a subset of more general state space
    models. Dynamic factor models are commonly used in economics for short-term
    forecasting due to possibility to summarize information from large datasets in
    a small number of factors. This package provides an implementation for dynamic
    factor models allowing for state variable to follow a vector autoregressive
    process or for the model coefficients to exhibit a Markov-switching pattern.
