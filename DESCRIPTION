Description: Efficient estimation of Dynamic Factor Models using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm 
  or two-step estimation, on datasets with missing data. The implementation follows advances in the econometric 
  literature i.e. estimation can be done either by running the Kalman Filter and Smoother once with initial values 
  from PCA, following Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2011), or via iterated Kalman Filtering and Smoothing until EM 
  convergence, folowing Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2012), or using the adapted EM algorithm of Banbura and Modugno 
  (2014), allowing estimation with arbitrary patterns of missing data. The implementation makes heavy use of the 
  Armadillo C++ library and the collapse package, permitting particularly speedy estimation. A comprehensive set of 
  methods allows for interpreting the model and forecasting. Information criteria to choose the number of factors 
  are also provided, following Bai and NG (2002).
