Dynamic Factor Models for R

**NOTE**: Package is under development and currently only estimates DFMs following

- Doz, C., Giannone, D., & Reichlin, L. (2011). A two-step estimator for large approximate dynamic factor models based on Kalman filtering. *Journal of Econometrics, 164*(1), 188-205.

- Doz, C., Giannone, D., & Reichlin, L. (2012). A quasi-maximum likelihood approach for large, approximate dynamic factor models. *Review of economics and statistics, 94*(4), 1014-1024.

The implementation is very efficient but less general compared to other CRAN packages such as *nowcasting* and *nowcastDFM* (i.e. no blocking or mixed-frequency models). There is ongoing work to implement a similarly efficient estimator following

- Banbura, M., & Modugno, M. (2014). Maximum likelihood estimation of factor models on datasets with arbitrary pattern of missing data. *Journal of Applied Econometrics, 29*(1), 133-160.
